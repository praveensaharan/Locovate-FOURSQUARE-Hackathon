**Personalized Place Recommendations using Geospatial AI, Mood, and Weather**

---

## About the Project

Around Me AI is a next-generation web application that delivers personalized place recommendations based on your **mood**, **local weather**, **time of day**, and **location**. By combining AI, geospatial data, and real-time weather, we help users discover the best places and activities tailored just for them.

- **AI-powered suggestions**: Get activity ideas based on your mood and context.
- **Weather-aware**: Recommendations adapt to current weather conditions.
- **Location-based**: Uses your device's location or IP to find nearby places.
- **Interactive maps**: Visualize places and routes with Google Maps.
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for a smooth experience.

## üí° How It Works

1. **Location Detection**: The app tries to get your geolocation (with fallback to IP-based location).
2. **Weather Fetching**: Retrieves real-time weather for your location.
3. **Mood Input**: You can speak your mood or pick from animated mood bubbles.
4. **AI Activity Suggestions**: The app uses AI to suggest activities based on your mood, weather, and time.
5. **Nearby Places**: Finds relevant places nearby using Foursquare and Google Maps.
6. **Interactive Map**: Visualizes your location, suggested places, and driving directions.
